# EEG Analysis for Intellectual Development Disorder

Deep learning has been shown to be able to support the analysis of imaging and 
signal based techniques such as electroencephalograms (EEG). In this work we 
apply deep learning methods in order to classify individuals with intellectual
developmental disorder (IDD) using EEG signals. The dataset used contains 7 
IDD subjects and 7 control subjects. EEG recordings were taken using a dry 
electrode system while subjects were in a resting state and while listening 
to music. Scalograms of the recordings were then generated using a Morlet 
wavelet. These scalograms were fed into a deep learning model for 
classification. This project compared the performance of using several fully 
connected and convolutional neural network (CNN) models. The highest accuracy
achieved was 98.9% and 99.8% while subjects were at rest and listening to 
music, respectively.
